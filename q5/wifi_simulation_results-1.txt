*** WiFi Simulation Results ***

--- Individual Tests (No Contention) ---
Station 1: 10.00 Mbits/sec, 14.6% estimated loss
Station 2: 26.40 Mbits/sec, 7.0% estimated loss
Total throughput: 36.40 Mbits/sec (sequential)

--- Simultaneous Tests (With Contention) ---
Station 1: 9.28 Mbits/sec, 13.9% estimated loss
Station 2: 24.30 Mbits/sec, 7.4% estimated loss
Total throughput: 33.58 Mbits/sec (concurrent)

*** Wireless Contention Analysis ***
Throughput change due to contention: -7.7%
Additional loss due to contention: -0.4%
