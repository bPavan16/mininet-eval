*** WiFi Simulation Results ***

--- Individual Tests (No Contention) ---
Station 1: 10.40 Mbits/sec, 15.1% estimated loss
Station 2: 25.30 Mbits/sec, 6.7% estimated loss
Total throughput: 35.70 Mbits/sec (sequential)

--- Simultaneous Tests (With Contention) ---
Station 1: 7.28 Mbits/sec, 25.1% estimated loss
Station 2: 17.71 Mbits/sec, 16.7% estimated loss
Total throughput: 24.99 Mbits/sec (concurrent)

*** Wireless Contention Analysis ***
Throughput change due to contention: -30.0%
Additional loss due to contention: 20.0%
