# Explanation of Wireless Contention:
# ----------------------------------
# In wireless networks, when multiple stations try to transmit simultaneously, 
# they must share the same medium (the air). Unlike wired networks where each 
# device can have a dedicated connection, wireless devices compete for transmission 
# opportunities.

# This contention typically causes:
# 1. Reduced overall throughput compared to sequential transmission
# 2. Increased packet loss due to collisions
# 3. Higher latency due to backoff mechanisms
# 4. Uneven distribution of bandwidth between stations

# The results above demonstrate these effects by comparing individual station 
# performance vs. performance under contention.
