*** Comparing RTS/CTS vs. No RTS/CTS Performance ***
*** Results comparison:
=== WITH RTS/CTS ===
Station 1: 13.60 Mbps, 0.0% loss
Station 2: 12.60 Mbps, 0.0% loss
Total throughput: 26.20 Mbps
Average packet loss: 0.0%

=== WITHOUT RTS/CTS ===
Station 1: 8.41 Mbps, 21.9% loss
Station 2: 8.41 Mbps, 26.3% loss
Total throughput: 16.82 Mbps
Average packet loss: 24.1%

*** Key observations:
1. RTS/CTS reduces collisions by coordinating transmissions
2. Without RTS/CTS, hidden terminals cause collisions and packet loss
3. Total network throughput is usually better with RTS/CTS
4. RTS/CTS trades individual station throughput for fairness
