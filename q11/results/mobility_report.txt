=== MOBILE STATION SIMULATION REPORT ===

SETUP:
- Three access points with a mobile station moving past them
- AP1 at position 20, AP2 at position 70, AP3 at position 120
- Link quality varies based on distance from each AP

HANDOVERS:
- Position 51.3: Handover from AP1 to AP2
- Position 102.7: Handover from AP2 to AP3

PING PERFORMANCE:
- Average RTT: 23.83 ms
- Minimum RTT: 20.00 ms
- Maximum RTT: 80.00 ms
- RTT spikes detected: 2

CONCLUSION:
The mobile station successfully performed 2 handovers
as it moved through the coverage areas of the three access points.
Significant RTT variation was observed during handovers.
